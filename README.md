# SSE Defense
## Problem Statement
After a compromise of one of our networked devices, this project was created to help monitor, analyze, and defend against cyberattacks from the internet.

Built from the ground up with the memory-safe language Rust, not only can it run long term, it is our first line of defense against targeted attacks.
