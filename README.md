# SSE NetKnight
## Problem Statement
After one of our networked devices got compromised, a defensive system was needed. This project was then created to help monitor, analyze, and defend against cyberattacks from the internet.

Built from the ground up with security in mind, it utilizes highly performant yet safe languages like Rust, while being flexible to adapt for different systems.

Our devices get hit with thousands of attack attempts per day, and using NetKnight, the defense is enhanced and automated.
